# Transcript Size Issue Fix

## Problem
The error log shows:
```
ERROR - Error saving transcript to database: 1406 (22001): Data too long for column 'transcript' at row 1
```

A transcript with 56,608 characters (from a 10,388 second / ~2.9 hour space) exceeded the MySQL TEXT column limit of 65,535 bytes.

## Solution

### 1. Database Schema Update
Run the SQL script to increase column sizes:
```bash
mysql -u your_username -p xspacedownloader < fix_transcript_column_size.sql
```

This changes:
- `transcript` column from TEXT to MEDIUMTEXT (16MB limit)
- `summary` column from TEXT to MEDIUMTEXT (16MB limit)
- Adds index on `language` column for better performance

### 2. Column Type Comparison
- **TEXT**: 65,535 bytes (~65KB) - Good for transcripts up to ~1 hour
- **MEDIUMTEXT**: 16,777,215 bytes (~16MB) - Good for transcripts up to ~50+ hours
- **LONGTEXT**: 4,294,967,295 bytes (~4GB) - Overkill for audio transcripts

### 3. Current Behavior
- Transcription still works for large files
- The corrective filter is automatically skipped for transcripts >50k chars (GPT-4o-mini token limit)
- Only the database save fails due to column size

### 4. Additional Considerations
- The corrective filter limit (50k chars) is appropriate for the GPT-4o-mini model
- Very long transcripts (>50k chars) will not get grammar/punctuation corrections
- This is acceptable as the raw transcript is still accurate

## Testing
After applying the fix:
1. Re-run transcription for the failed space
2. Verify transcript saves successfully
3. Check that shorter transcripts still get corrective filtering

## Future Improvements
- Consider chunking very long transcripts for corrective filtering
- Add transcript size warnings in the UI
- Monitor typical transcript sizes to optimize column types
