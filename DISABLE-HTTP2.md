# Disable HTTP/2 to Fix Audio Streaming Issues

## Changes Made

### 1. Flask App (app.py)
- Removed X-Accel-Redirect implementation
- Reverted to direct Flask file serving with `send_file()`
- Uses `conditional=True` for basic range request support

### 2. Nginx Configuration Changes Required

**MAIN CHANGE**: Remove `http2` from the SSL listen directive:

```nginx
# BEFORE:
listen 443 ssl http2; # managed by Certbot

# AFTER: 
listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
```

**ADDITIONAL OPTIMIZATIONS** for the `/download/` location:

```nginx
location ^~ /download/ {
    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    proxy_http_version 1.1;
    
    # Core proxy headers
    proxy_set_header Host $host;
    proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    
    # Disable upgrade headers for downloads
    proxy_set_header Upgrade "";
    proxy_set_header Connection "";
    
    # Disable proxy buffering for streaming
    proxy_buffering off;
    proxy_request_buffering off;
    
    # Longer timeouts for large files
    proxy_connect_timeout 60s;
    proxy_send_timeout 600s;
    proxy_read_timeout 600s;
    
    proxy_redirect off;
}
```

**REMOVE** the internal `/downloads/` location block since we're not using X-Accel-Redirect anymore.

## Quick Fix Steps

1. **Edit your Nginx config**:
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/xspacedownload.com.conf
   ```

2. **Make this ONE critical change**:
   ```nginx
   # Change this line:
   listen 443 ssl http2; # managed by Certbot
   # To this:
   listen 443 ssl; # managed by Certbot
   ```

3. **Remove the internal downloads location** (the entire block):
   ```nginx
   # REMOVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK:
   location ^~ /downloads/ {
       internal;
       alias /var/www/production/xspacedownload.com/website/htdocs/downloads/;
       # ... entire block
   }
   ```

4. **Test and reload Nginx**:
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t
   sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

5. **Restart your Flask app** to pick up the code changes.

## Why This Works

- **HTTP/1.1**: Better compatibility with range requests for media streaming
- **No HTTP/2 framing issues**: Eliminates protocol errors when seeking
- **Direct Flask serving**: Simple, reliable file serving
- **Proxy optimizations**: Disabled buffering for better streaming

## Expected Result

- ✅ No more `net::ERR_HTTP2_PROTOCOL_ERROR`
- ✅ Smooth seeking in audio player
- ✅ Proper range request handling
- ✅ Better streaming performance

The trade-off is slightly reduced performance for other requests, but audio streaming will work perfectly.
