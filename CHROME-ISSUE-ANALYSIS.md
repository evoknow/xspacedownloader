# Chrome ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE Analysis

## Confirmed Facts âœ…

1. **Server works perfectly**: `curl` shows proper 206 responses with range requests
2. **Not a Plyr issue**: Direct file access in Chrome still fails when seeking
3. **Chrome-specific problem**: Range requests fail in browser but work via curl

## Root Cause Analysis

### The Issue: Chrome HTTP/1.1 Connection Handling

Even though we disabled HTTP/2, Chrome might be:
1. **Connection pooling issues** - Chrome reuses connections differently than curl
2. **Request pipelining problems** - Multiple rapid range requests confusing the connection
3. **Content-Length vs Transfer-Encoding conflicts** - Chrome expects specific headers
4. **Connection keep-alive issues** - Chrome closing connections prematurely

## Solutions to Try

### Solution 1: Force Connection Close (Most Likely Fix)

Add this to your Nginx `/audio/` location:

```nginx
location ^~ /audio/ {
    alias /var/www/production/xspacedownload.com/website/htdocs/downloads/;
    
    try_files $uri =404;
    
    # FORCE connection close for each request
    add_header Connection "close" always;
    
    sendfile on;
    tcp_nopush on;
    tcp_nodelay on;
    gzip off;
    
    add_header Accept-Ranges bytes always;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, max-age=3600" always;
    
    location ~* \.mp3$ {
        add_header Content-Type audio/mpeg always;
        add_header Connection "close" always;
    }
}
```

### Solution 2: Disable Keep-Alive for Audio

```nginx
location ^~ /audio/ {
    alias /var/www/production/xspacedownload.com/website/htdocs/downloads/;
    
    try_files $uri =404;
    
    # Disable keep-alive for audio requests
    keepalive_timeout 0;
    add_header Connection "close" always;
    
    # ... rest of config
}
```

### Solution 3: Use Smaller Sendfile Chunks

```nginx
location ^~ /audio/ {
    alias /var/www/production/xspacedownload.com/website/htdocs/downloads/;
    
    try_files $uri =404;
    
    # Smaller chunks for better range compatibility
    sendfile on;
    sendfile_max_chunk 64k;  # Much smaller
    
    # ... rest of config
}
```

### Solution 4: Disable Sendfile Entirely for Audio

```nginx
location ^~ /audio/ {
    alias /var/www/production/xspacedownload.com/website/htdocs/downloads/;
    
    try_files $uri =404;
    
    # Disable sendfile completely for audio
    sendfile off;
    
    # ... rest of config
}
```

## Immediate Test

Try **Solution 1** first (Connection: close) - this is the most common fix for Chrome range request issues.

## Why This Happens

Chrome's HTTP/1.1 implementation is more strict about connection reuse with range requests. When Chrome makes multiple range requests on the same connection, it can get confused if the server doesn't handle connection state properly.

The `Connection: close` header forces Chrome to open a new connection for each range request, which usually solves the problem.

## Next Steps

1. Try Solution 1 (Connection: close)
2. Test seeking in Chrome
3. If still failing, try Solution 4 (disable sendfile)
4. Monitor Nginx error logs during testing
