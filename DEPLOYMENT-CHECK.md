# Deployment Status Check

## Issue: Template changes not reflecting on live site

The space page still shows Plyr interface despite our code changes being committed and pushed.

## Possible Causes:

### 1. Flask App Not Restarted
Flask might be caching the templates or running an older version.

**Solution:**
```bash
# On your server, restart the Flask application
sudo systemctl restart your-flask-app-service
# OR if running manually:
pkill -f "python.*app.py"
# Then restart your Flask app
```

### 2. Different Deployment Process
The live site might be pulling from a different branch or using a different deployment method.

**Check:**
```bash
# On your server, check which branch is deployed
cd /path/to/your/xspacedownloader
git branch
git log --oneline -1

# Should show: a3771d0 Temporarily disable Plyr to test ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE issue
```

### 3. Template Caching
Flask might have template caching enabled.

**Solution:**
```python
# In your Flask app config
app.config['TEMPLATES_AUTO_RELOAD'] = True
```

### 4. CDN/Proxy Caching
If you're using a CDN or have caching enabled, the old templates might be cached.

**Solution:**
```bash
# Clear any caches
# Check if there's a CDN cache to clear
```

## Quick Test Commands

Run these on your server where the Flask app is hosted:

```bash
# 1. Check current code version
cd /var/www/production/xspacedowoad.com/website/htdocs
git log --oneline -1

# 2. Check if Flask app is running
ps aux | grep python | grep app.py

# 3. Restart Flask app (adjust service name as needed)
sudo systemctl restart xspacedownloader
# OR
sudo service xspacedownloader restart

# 4. Check Flask app logs
sudo journalctl -u xspacedownloader -f
```

## Immediate Solution

If you have server access, try:

1. **Pull latest changes:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/app
   git pull origin main
   ```

2. **Restart Flask:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart your-flask-service
   ```

3. **Test immediately:**

The template should show native HTML5 controls with the debug message.
