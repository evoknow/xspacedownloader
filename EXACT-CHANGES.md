# EXACT CHANGES NEEDED

## Issue Found
Your config is missing the `http2 off;` directive. The line `http2 off;` should be at the server level, not with the listen directive.

## Change #1: Add http2 off at the top

**ADD this line after `server_name`:**

```nginx
server {
    server_name xspacedownload.com;
    
    # ADD THIS LINE:
    http2 off;
    
    sendfile on;
    sendfile_max_chunk 1m;
    # ... rest of your config
}
```

## Change #2: Test range requests

After making the change, test range requests:

```bash
# Test range request (this is what the browser does when seeking)
curl -I -H "Range: bytes=1048576-2097151" https://xspacedownload.com/audio/1lDxLnrWjwkGm.mp3
```

**You should see:**
```
HTTP/1.1 206 Partial Content
Content-Range: bytes 1048576-2097151/228108168
Accept-Ranges: bytes
```

**If you see `HTTP/1.1 200 OK` instead of `206 Partial Content`, that's the problem!**

## Change #3: Alternative - Reduce sendfile chunk size

If range requests still don't work, also change:

```nginx
# Change this:
sendfile_max_chunk 1m;

# To this:
sendfile_max_chunk 512k;
```

## Change #4: If still failing, disable sendfile for audio

As a last resort, disable sendfile for the audio location:

```nginx
location ^~ /audio/ {
    alias /var/www/production/xspacedownload.com/website/htdocs/downloads/;
    
    # Disable sendfile for audio location
    sendfile off;
    
    # ... rest of config
}
```

## Test Commands

1. **Make the change and reload:**
   ```bash
   sudo nginx -t && sudo systemctl reload nginx
   ```

2. **Test range request:**
   ```bash
   curl -I -H "Range: bytes=1048576-" https://xspacedownload.com/audio/1lDxLnrWjwkGm.mp3
   ```

3. **Check in browser dev tools:**
   - Look at Network tab
   - The requests should show `206` status instead of `200`
   - Look for `Content-Range` header in responses
