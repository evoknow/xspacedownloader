# API Controller Endpoint Fixes

This document describes the fixes made to the API controller endpoints that were failing.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User list_users Method Missing

**Error**: `'User' object has no attribute 'list_users'`

**Fix**: Implemented the `list_users` method in the `User` class that allows filtering by status and username, with pagination support. Also added a `count_users` method to support pagination metadata.

```python
def list_users(self, status=None, username=None, limit=20, offset=0):
    """
    List users with optional filtering.
    
    Args:
        status (str, optional): Filter by user status
        username (str, optional): Filter by username
        limit (int, optional): Maximum number of results
        offset (int, optional): Pagination offset
        
    Returns:
        list: List of user dictionaries
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

### 2. Space list_spaces Method Missing search_term Parameter

**Error**: `Space.list_spaces() got an unexpected keyword argument 'search_term'`

**Fix**: Updated the `list_spaces` method in the `Space` class to accept a `search_term` parameter and added filtering logic to search in the filename, notes, and URL fields. Also added a `count_spaces` method to support pagination metadata.

```python
def list_spaces(self, user_id=None, visitor_id=None, status=None, search_term=None, limit=10, offset=0):
    """
    List spaces with optional filtering.
    
    Args:
        user_id (int, optional): Filter by user_id
        visitor_id (str, optional): Filter by visitor_id (browser_id in current schema)
        status (str, optional): Filter by status
        search_term (str, optional): Search in title (filename) or notes
        limit (int, optional): Maximum number of results
        offset (int, optional): Pagination offset
        
    Returns:
        list: List of space dictionaries
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

### 3. Tag get_tag_by_name Method Missing

**Error**: `'Tag' object has no attribute 'get_tag_by_name'`

**Fix**: Implemented the `get_tag_by_name` method in the `Tag` class to retrieve a tag ID by its name. This method is used when assigning tags to spaces. Also added additional helper methods needed for tag operations:

```python
def get_tag_by_name(self, tag_name):
    """
    Get tag ID by name.
    
    Args:
        tag_name (str): Tag name
        
    Returns:
        int: Tag ID or None if not found
    """
    # Implementation details...
```

Additionally, implemented:
- `get_tags_for_space` - Alias for `get_space_tags` for backwards compatibility
- `tag_space` - Add a tag to a space
- `remove_all_tags_from_space` - Remove all tags from a space
- `get_spaces_by_tag` - Get spaces with a specific tag
- `count_spaces_by_tag` - Count spaces with a specific tag

## Testing

A test script `test_api_fixed.py` was created to verify these fixes. To run it:

1. Make sure the API server is running:
   ```
   python3 api_controller.py
   ```

2. Create a text file called `test_api_key.txt` containing a valid API key

3. Run the test script:
   ```
   python3 test_api_fixed.py
   ```

The script will test all three fixed endpoints and report the results.
