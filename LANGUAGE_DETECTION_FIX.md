# Language Detection Fix

## Problem
When audio is not in English, the transcript is created in the native language but the language type is incorrectly set to "English" (or "unknown") in the database. This prevents proper translation workflows later.

**Error Pattern:**
- Audio in Bengali/Hindi/Arabic → Transcript correctly transcribed in native script
- Database language field → Incorrectly set to "en-US" or "unknown"  
- Translation attempts → Fail because system thinks it's already English

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. OpenAI API Issue (Primary)
In `SpeechToText.py`, when using `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe` with "json" response format:
```python
# BEFORE (Line 307)
"language": language if language else "unknown"  # ❌ Hardcoded fallback
```

The OpenAI API **does** detect the language internally, but the "json" response format doesn't return it. The code defaulted to "unknown" instead of analyzing the transcript text.

### 2. Chunked Transcription Issue
Similar problem in chunked transcription (large files >25MB):
```python
# BEFORE (Line 461)  
chunk_language = language if language else "unknown"  # ❌ Same issue
```

### 3. Background Service Parameters
The background transcription service often calls with `language=None` expecting auto-detection, but the detection logic wasn't working properly.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Added Text-Based Language Detection
Created `_detect_language_from_text()` method that analyzes transcript content:
- **Character script detection**: Bengali (০-৯), Arabic (٠-٩), Devanagari (०-९)
- **Word pattern matching**: Common words for English, Spanish, French, German
- **Fallback logic**: Intelligent defaults based on script type

### 2. Fixed OpenAI API Language Detection
```python
# AFTER (Lines 305-313)
detected_language = language if language else self._detect_language_from_text(raw_text)
result = {
    "text": raw_text,
    "language": detected_language,  # ✅ Now uses detected language
    "duration": audio_duration,
    "segments": segments
}
```

### 3. Fixed Chunked Transcription
```python
# AFTER (Lines 465-468)
if i == 0 and not language and chunk_text.strip():
    detected_language = self._detect_language_from_text(chunk_text)
chunk_language = detected_language  # ✅ Uses detected language consistently
```

### 4. Language Detection Algorithm
Supports detection of:
- **Bengali** (`bn`) - Unicode range 0x0980-0x09FF
- **Hindi** (`hi`) - Devanagari script 0x0900-0x097F
- **Arabic** (`ar`) - Arabic script 0x0600-0x06FF  
- **Urdu** (`ur`) - Arabic script with Urdu word patterns
- **English** (`en`) - Latin script with English word patterns
- **Spanish** (`es`) - Common Spanish words
- **French** (`fr`) - Common French words
- **German** (`de`) - Common German words

### 5. Database Fix Script
Created `fix_transcript_languages.py` to:
- Analyze existing transcripts with incorrect language detection
- Re-detect languages using the new algorithm
- Update database records with correct language codes
- Provide summary of changes made

## Testing

### 1. Language Detection Tests
`test_language_detection.py` verifies detection accuracy with:
- Sample texts in 7 different languages
- Edge cases (empty text, mixed scripts, numbers)
- Character script recognition
- Word pattern matching

### 2. Expected Results
- ✅ Bengali text → Detected as `bn`
- ✅ Hindi text → Detected as `hi`  
- ✅ Arabic text → Detected as `ar`
- ✅ English text → Detected as `en`
- ✅ Mixed scripts → Detected by dominant script

## Migration Steps

### 1. Update Existing Database Records
```bash
python3 fix_transcript_languages.py
```

### 2. Verify Fix is Working
1. Transcribe new non-English audio
2. Check database: `SELECT space_id, language FROM space_transcripts ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10`
3. Verify language field shows correct code (bn, hi, ar, etc.) not "unknown"

### 3. Test Translation Workflow
1. Transcribe Bengali/Hindi audio
2. Verify language is correctly detected as `bn`/`hi`
3. Request English translation 
4. Verify translation works properly

## Impact

### Before Fix
- ❌ Non-English transcripts marked as "unknown" or "en"
- ❌ Translation workflows broken
- ❌ Users couldn't get English translations of foreign audio

### After Fix  
- ✅ Accurate language detection for 8+ languages
- ✅ Translation workflows function correctly
- ✅ Proper language metadata for filtering/search
- ✅ Better user experience for multilingual content

## Future Improvements
1. Add more language patterns (Japanese, Korean, Chinese, etc.)
2. Use dedicated language detection libraries (langdetect, polyglot)
3. Train custom models for audio-specific language detection
4. Add confidence scores for language detection results
