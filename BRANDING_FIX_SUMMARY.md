# Branding Configuration Fix Summary

## Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. **Missing loadBrandingConfig() Call**
- **Problem**: The `loadBrandingConfig()` function was not being called when the Settings tab was activated
- **Fix**: Added `loadBrandingConfig()` to the settings tab event listener at line 1478

### 2. **Duplicate Event Listeners**
- **Problem**: There were two duplicate event listeners for the settings tab (lines 1475 and 2222)
- **Fix**: Removed the duplicate event listener at line 2222

### 3. **Field Name Mismatch**
- **Problem**: JavaScript was sending different field names than what the Python API expected
  - JS was sending: `title`, `watermark`, `color`, `font`, `logo`, `enabled`
  - API expected: `video_title_branding`, `video_watermark_text`, `brand_color`, `font_family`, `brand_logo_url`, `branding_enabled`
- **Fix**: Updated JavaScript to use the correct field names in both save and load functions

### 4. **Form Submit Handler Setup**
- **Problem**: The form submit event listener was being added at the top level before DOM was ready
- **Fix**: Moved the form submit handler setup inside `initializeBrandingConfig()` function

## Current Implementation

### JavaScript (admin.html)
1. **Initialization**: `initializeBrandingConfig()` is called when DOM is ready
2. **Loading**: `loadBrandingConfig()` is called when Settings tab is shown
3. **Saving**: Form submit handler properly sends data with correct field names
4. **Preview**: Real-time preview updates as user types

### Python API (app.py)
1. **GET /admin/api/branding_config**: Returns current branding configuration
2. **POST /admin/api/branding_config**: Updates branding configuration in mainconfig.json

### Configuration Storage
- Branding settings are stored in `mainconfig.json`:
  - `video_title_branding`
  - `video_watermark_text`
  - `brand_color`
  - `font_family`
  - `brand_logo_url`
  - `branding_enabled`

## Testing

Use the provided `test_branding_api.py` script to verify the API endpoints are working:

```bash
# Update the admin credentials in the script first
python test_branding_api.py
```

## Debug Logging

Added console.log statements to help debug:
- When loading branding config
- When saving branding config
- The data being sent to the server

You can open the browser console (F12) to see these logs when testing.

## Next Steps

1. Test the branding configuration in the admin panel
2. Verify settings are saved and loaded correctly
3. Check that the Video Generator component uses these settings
4. Remove debug console.log statements once everything is working
