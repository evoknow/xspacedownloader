# Stripe Payment Setup Guide

## ✅ What's Already Implemented

The complete Stripe payment system has been deployed with:

- **Credit Transactions Table**: `credit_txn` for tracking all purchases
- **Payment Component**: Full Stripe integration with checkout and webhooks
- **Payment Routes**: All necessary API endpoints for payment processing
- **Frontend Integration**: Stripe.js integrated into pricing page
- **Purchase History**: Displayed in user profile page
- **Webhook Handling**: Complete payment lifecycle management

## 🔧 Stripe Configuration Required

### 1. Environment Variables (✅ Available)
The following keys are already available in `/var/www/production/xspacedownload.com/website/htdocs/.env`:
- `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` - For frontend Stripe.js
- `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` - For backend API calls

### 2. Webhook Configuration (⚠️ Required)
You need to add the webhook secret to complete the setup:

1. **Go to Stripe Dashboard** → Developers → Webhooks
2. **Create webhook endpoint**: `https://xspacedownload.com/payment/webhook`
3. **Select events to listen for**:
   - `checkout.session.completed`
   - `payment_intent.succeeded`
   - `payment_intent.payment_failed`
   - `invoice.payment_succeeded` (for recurring payments)
4. **Copy the webhook signing secret** and add to `.env`:
   ```
   STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
   ```

### 3. Product Configuration (✅ Ready)
Your products are already configured:
- CR-10: $10 for 100 credits
- CR-20: $20 for 500 credits  
- CR-30: $30 for 1000 credits
- CR-99: $99/month for 1000 credits (recurring)

## 🚀 How It Works

### Purchase Flow
1. User clicks "Purchase Now" on `/pricing`
2. Stripe Checkout session created
3. User completes payment on Stripe
4. Webhook confirms payment
5. Credits automatically added to user account
6. Transaction recorded in `credit_txn` table
7. Purchase appears in user's profile history

### Admin Features
- View all products at `/admin/products`
- Manage product details, pricing, and images
- Track purchase transactions in database

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Mode
- Use Stripe test keys for development
- Test card: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Use any future expiry date and CVC

### Production
- Switch to live Stripe keys
- Configure webhook with live endpoint
- Monitor transactions in Stripe Dashboard

## 📊 Database Tables

### `credit_txn`
Tracks all purchase transactions:
- User ID and product details
- Payment amounts and credit quantities
- Stripe payment intent and session IDs
- Payment status and timestamps

### Integration with Existing `transactions`
Successful purchases also create entries in the main `transactions` table for credit balance tracking.

## 🔒 Security Features

- **Webhook Signature Verification**: Ensures webhooks are from Stripe
- **User Authentication**: Only logged-in users can purchase
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Transaction tracking prevents double-crediting
- **Secure Payment Processing**: All sensitive data handled by Stripe

## 📈 Ready for Production

The system is fully functional and ready to accept real payments once the webhook secret is configured. All purchase data will be properly tracked and credits automatically added to user accounts.
